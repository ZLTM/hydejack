<p>Incomplete Vessel is a game created for the Global Game Jam 2020, it's inspired in the slenderman subgenre but it gaves it a spin by having the player build its own monster in order to finish the game.</p>

<p>Incomplete Vessel was my first time designing and also putting together a level for a 3D game.</p>
