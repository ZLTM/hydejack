> In SUNE I focus on the characters and world building using minimal gameplay to deliver a branching narrative in wich the player itself is a character that interacts with the protagonist breaking the 4 wall.

SUNE is my first experience creating a visualnovel, for this I used Fungus, an asset that works with Unity specialised in text procesing and branching paths.
