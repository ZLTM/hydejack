<p>SUNE is a narrative horror game focused on the characters and world building using minimal gameplay to deliver a branching narrative in wich the player itself is a character that interacts with the protagonist.</p>

<p>SUNE is my first experience creating a visualnovel, for this I used Fungus, a framework useful to handle dialogue on adventure games.</p>
