<p>Wrong way is a horror narrative driving game inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7asz8x/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1/" target="_blank"> the left and right story,</a> in it the player uses a pc installed on its car to receive specific instructions on how to traverse trough a cursed road at the same time she chats with the other drivers.</p>

<p>The hardest part of Wrong Way was integrating fungus, a framework used on adventure games to show context text, as a dialogue management system for our horror driving game.</p>
