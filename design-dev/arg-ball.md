<p>Roll An ARG Ball uses a target to create an interactable virtual environment visible through a phone camera, using a pappersheet with the target a virtual maze is created and a ball spawned, the player is then able to tak the ball out of the maze by tilting the papper sheet.</p>

<p>In this project I learned about ARG development on Unity and the current limitations, specially the phisics system wich i had to customize in order for the ball to roll as it was being pulled by gravity.</p>
