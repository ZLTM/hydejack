As a developer I'm interested in creating intuitive, original and memorable experiences for the users, that's the reason why I specialize in video games design, development and translation, disciplines in which I have worked with very talented people and managed to get our products covered by the press and into national contests.

When I'm not working I'm interested in interacting and learning from different cultures, their legends, and their stories, experimenting in the kitchen and consume every kind of media.

Now I'm working as a freelancer I'm especially interested in working Abroad so I can keep learning from the best.

If you are interested in my work (or want to talk about the multiculturalism in Bolivia) please contact me :)
