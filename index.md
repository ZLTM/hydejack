    <center><h3>About Me</h3></center>
      <p>I’m mostly interested in games as narrative experiences from adventure games to visual novels, point-and-click, and puzzles as well as evocative experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
      When I’m not working I’m interested in interacting and learning from different cultures, their legends, their stories, and the occult in general, I also like to experiment in the kitchen and consuming every kind of media.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you like my work (or want to talk about the multiculturalism in Bolivia) please contact me :)

      <b>Games Translator - Freelance 2016 - Now</b>

      <b>Co-founder, organizer - Bolivian Videogames Asosiation (ABV) 2016 - 2018</b>
        <p>Years ago the Bolivian videogame scene was very descentralized, the ABV tackled this problem by creating an asosiation ready to help any developer in the area, i was able to join this project as a founding member and, later on, as an organizer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Working on the ABV has been very fulfilling, I was able to help a community grow while helping new members giving talks on game design and narrative as I kept working on my own projects for the different events we held.
        </p>
      <br>
      <b>API Automation engineer - Jalasoft 2020 - Now</b>
        <p>Now working as an automation engineer for the largest software company in Bolivia with important clients arround the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
        In Jalasoft I am able to work directly with important clients, the quality in the code is constantly under review and the features implemented are a challenge on theyself.
        </p>
      <br>
      <b>GUI Automation engineer - Processmaker 2018 - 2020</b>
        <p>Worked for one of the top 3 companies of the country, was able to pitch project ideas and see their execution from the design to the production phase.
        </p>
        <p>
        While on processmaker I helped to implement one automation framework in java and developed other two, one of them also in java and the other one in python, this last one also works together with a companion web-app that allows the employees to run tests with different configurations even when they dont have technical knowledge.
